## Problem statement
   However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills



## Task
   1.    Check ‘ad-hoc-requests.pdf’ - there are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business 
         needs insights.
   2.    You need to run a SQL query to answer these requests. 
   3.    The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence you need to 
         create a presentation to show the insights.
